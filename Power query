Text Based Operations

Splitting Column: Used to break a single column into multiple parts based on a rule or pattern
Why Do We Split Columns?
 To extract useful parts of text.
 To separate values stored together (e.g., First & Last Name, Date & Time).
 Helps in organizing and analyzing data better.
To Access Split Options: Power Query Editor → Home tab → Split Column

Types of Splitting Options:
1. Split by Delimiter
 Delimiter = A symbol or character that separates values (e.g., comma ,, space , hyphen -)
 Power Query automatically detects common delimiters or allows you to set a custom one.
Example: Column:"John,Doe" Split by delimiter (,) → ["John", "Doe"]
Use Cases:
 Split full name: "John Doe" → "John" and "Doe"
 Split address: "Bangalore, Karnataka" → "Bangalore" and "Karnataka"
2. Split by Number of Characters
 Splits text after a specific number of characters.
Example: Column:"ABCDEF" Split after 3 characters → ["ABC", "DEF"]
Use Case:
 Fixed-length codes (e.g., "PIN123" → "PIN" and "123")
3. Split by Positions
 You define exact positions where the column should split.
Example: Column:"20240521" Split at positions: 4, 6 → ["2024", "05", "21"]
Use Case:
 Splitting date string into year, month, and day.
4. Split by Uppercase to Lowercase Transition
 Splits text wherever there's a change from uppercase to lowercase.
Example: "PowerBIUser" → ["Power", "B", "I", "User"]
Use Case:
 Breaking camel case text used in code or identifiers.
5. Split by Digit to Non-Digit or Non-Digit to Digit
 Useful for data like "Product123" → ["Product", "123"]
Merging Columns:
 Merging columns means combining two or more columns into a single text column.
 It's useful when you want to create full names, addresses, or unique IDs by joining text from multiple columns.
When Do You Use Merge?
 Combine First Name and Last Name
 Merge City, State, and Country
 Create custom codes or identifiers
To Merge Columns: Home tab → Transform tab → Merge Columns
Steps to Merge Columns:
1. Select the columns you want to merge (hold Ctrl to select multiple).
2. Click on Merge Columns under the Transform tab.
3. Choose a separator:
o Space
o Comma
o Dash
o None
o Custom (e.g., “ | ”)
4. Name the new merged column.
5. Click OK.

Important Notes:
 Only Text columns can be merged directly.
 For numbers/dates, first convert them to Text using:
Transform → Data Type → Text
 Original columns remain unless you choose to remove them.
 Always rename the merged column meaningfully (e.g., "Full Name").
Full Name
John Doe

Formatting Text: Used to clean and standardize text data for better analysis
Why Format Text?
 Ensure consistency in spelling and structure.
 Make your data clean and ready for visuals or analysis.
 Fix common data entry issues like extra spaces, wrong case, inconsistent symbols.
To Format Text: Power Query Editor → Transform tab → Format dropdown
Text Formatting Options
1. UPPERCASE
 Converts all letters to CAPITALS.
 Good for standardizing codes, names, etc.
Example: "bangalore" → "BANGALORE"
2. lowercase
 Converts all letters to small case.
Example: "DATA SCIENCE" → "data science"
3. Capitalize Each Word
 Makes the first letter of each word uppercase, rest lowercase.
Example: "data analyst" → "Data Analyst"
Use Case: Formatting names, cities, titles.
4. Trim
 Removes extra spaces from the beginning and end of text.
Example: " John " → "John"
Use Case: Clean up manual entries or copied data.
5. Clean
 Removes non-printable characters (e.g., invisible symbols copied from web or PDFs).
Example: "Hello World" (with hidden character) → "Hello World"
6. Add Prefix / Add Suffix
 Adds text before (prefix) or after (suffix) each value.
Example – Add Prefix: Original: "123" → With prefix "ID-" → "ID-123"
Example – Add Suffix: Original: "Bangalore" → With suffix " City" → "Bangalore City"
Real-Life Use Cases:

Extracting Text: Used to pull out specific parts of text from a column
Why Use Text Extract?
 Extract useful parts from longer strings.
 Focus only on the needed portion of a value (e.g., first name from full name, domain from email).
 Helps in cleaning, splitting, and transforming data into usable formats.
To Access Extract: Transform tab → Extract (Dropdown)
Extract Options:
1. Extract First Characters
 Extracts the first N characters from the left.
Example: "Bangalore" → Extract first 3 → "Ban"
Use Case: Get area codes, year (from date string like "2024-05-21")
2. Extract Last Characters
 Extracts the last N characters from the right.
Example: "ABC12345" → Extract last 3 → "345"
Use Case: Get ID suffix, last digits of a code.
3. Extract Range
 Extracts characters starting from a position with a specific length.
Syntax: Start position (0-based) and Number of characters
Example: Text: "Karnataka" Start at 3, length 4 → "nata"
Use Case: Slice specific parts of fixed-format codes.
4. Text Before Delimiter
 Extracts everything before the specified character or symbol.
Example: "john.doe@gmail.com" Delimiter: @ → "john.doe"
Use Case: Get username from an email.
5. Text After Delimiter
 Extracts everything after the specified delimiter.
Example: "john.doe@gmail.com" Delimiter: @ → "gmail.com"
Use Case: Extract domain from email, location from a code.
6. Text Between Delimiters
 Extracts text between two specified delimiters.
Example: "Name[12345]Code" Start: [ , End: ] → "12345"
Use Case: Extract codes, tags, or IDs within brackets or quotes.

Purpose: Extracts only the time part from a datetime value. Use case: You want to remove the date and just keep values like 08:30:00. Example: 2024-05-01 08:30:00 → 08:30:00
2. Local Time
Purpose: Converts a datetime value into the local system time zone. Use case: Working with data from different time zones and want to align all to your local time. Example: UTC 03:00 → adjusted to local time zone (e.g., +05:30)
3. Parse
Purpose: Converts a text string that looks like a time into an actual time data type. Use case: When your time column is in text format like "14:45" and you want to use time functions. Example: "14:45" (Text) → 14:45:00 (Time)
4. Hour → From/Start of/End of
Purpose: Extracts hour part or rounds time to start/end of the hour.
 Hour → From: Pulls just the hour (e.g., 14:30:00 → 14)
 Start of Hour: Rounds down to 14:00:00
 End of Hour: Rounds up to 14:59:59
5. Minute
Purpose: Extracts the minute component from a time value. Example: 14:45:30 → 45
6. Second
Purpose: Extracts the second part from a time value. Example: 14:45:30 → 30
7. Subtract
Purpose: Subtracts one time value from another. Returns a duration. Use case: Calculate time differences (e.g., working hours) Example: Logout - Login = Duration (02:15:00)
8. Combine Date and Time
Purpose: Combines two separate columns — one with date, one with time — into a single datetime column. Example:
 Date: 2025-06-12
 Time: 14:00:00
 Combined: 2025-06-12 14:00:00
9. Earliest
Purpose: Returns the earliest (minimum) time from the selected column. Use case: Identify first log-in, start time, etc.
10. Latest

Transformations on any column type:
Path: Home Tab → Transform Group (Ribbon) → Any Column section
1. Data Type: Date/Time
Purpose: Change the data type of a column to Date, Time, DateTime, Decimal, Text, etc. Example: "2025-06-12" (text) → Date type
2. Replace Values
Purpose: Replaces specific values with something else. Example: Replace "null" with "N/A"(Useful for cleaning messy or inconsistent data.)
3. Unpivot Columns
Purpose: Converts wide data into long format (attribute-value pairs). Example: Turn multiple columns into two columns: one for headers, one for values.Great for normalizing data for analysis.
4. Detect Data Type
Purpose: Automatically assigns data types to all columns.
Use this after importing raw data. Example: "123" → converted to Whole Number
5. Fill (Down/Up)
Purpose: Fills missing values with the value above or below. Example:Fill Down → Fills "HR" for B too

General Advance Operations:
Button
What it Does
Typical Use Case
Mini Walk-Through & Result
Column From Examples(Add Column From Examples)
Learns a transformation from the examples you type.
“I need a new column that shows ‘Last, First’ names—but I don’t want to write any code.”
1. Select First Name & Last Name.
2. Column from Examples >From Selection.
3. In the new preview column, type “Smith, John”.
Power Query infers: Text.Combine({[LastName],[First Name]}, ", ") → Auto-builds the column for every row.
Custom Column
Lets you write an M formula of any complexity.
Calculations that the GUI can’t do directly (ratios, nested IFs, etc.).
Example: Profit= [Revenue] - [Cost]
Invoke Custom Function
Runs a user-defined function on each row, returning the result into a new column.
Re-use logic (e.g., distance between two lat/longs, an API call, a fiscal-year converter).
1. Create function fxFiscalYear(Date).
2. Add Column > Invoke Custom Function.
3. Pass [OrderDate] into the function. → New Fiscal Year column.
Conditional Column
Builds an IF…THEN…ELSE column without writing code.
Banding / labels (High, Medium, Low), pass/fail flags, text categorisation.
Configure:If [Sales] ≥ 1000 then "High"else if [Sales] ≥ 500 then "Medium"else "Low"
Index Column(From 0, From 1, or Custom)
Adds a running number.
Primary key substitute, order preservation, ranking, join helper.
Add Column >Index Column >From 1 → 1, 2, 3 …
Duplicate Column
Makes a copy of a column, leaving the original untouched.
Try a risky transformation without losing the original; set up splitting/formatting while preserving raw data.
Right-click ProductName > Duplicate Column. Rename copy to ProductName_Clean and apply transformations only to the duplicate.

What is Data Modelling in Power BI?
Data modelling is the process of connecting different tables using relationships and optimizing your data structure to enable powerful analysis with DAX and visuals.
Key Components of Data Modelling
1. Tables
 Imported from various sources (Excel, SQL, APIs, etc.)
 Can be fact (transactions) or dimension (lookup).
Fact Table:
 Stores transactional data
 Contains foreign keys that relate to dimension tables
 Grows over time (new rows keep adding)
 Includes measures (like SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.)
Dimension Table:
 Contains unique values (primary key)
 Used to filter, group, and slice data in visuals
 Typically small in size
2. Relationships
 Connect tables using common columns (keys)
 Types:
o One-to-many (most common)
o Many-to-one
o Many-to-many (rare & needs careful handling)
3. Primary & Foreign Keys
 Used to relate two tables:
o Customer ID in Customer Table (primary key)
o Customer ID in Sales Table (foreign key)
4. Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema
 Star Schema: Fact table in center, connected to dimensions
 Snowflake Schema: Dimensions are normalized (sub-tables linked to dimension tables)
Important Tools in Power BI for Modelling
Feature
Use
Manage Relationships
View/edit relationships between tables
Model View
Drag-drop to create/manage relationships visually
Mark as Date Table
Designate a calendar table for time intelligence
Hide Columns
Hide technical columns from report view
Create Calculated Columns/Measures
Add logic using DAX
Role-Level Security (RLS)
Restrict data visibility based on user roles
Best Practices
1. Use surrogate keys (like ID numbers) instead of names for relationships.
2. Avoid bi-directional relationships unless necessary.
3. Keep your model as flat (star-schema) as possible.
4. Always create a Calendar Table for time-based analysis.
5. Use measures over calculated columns for efficiency.
Example
Tables:
 Sales (Fact Table): Sale ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Date, Quantity, Revenue
 Customers (Dim Table): Customer ID, Name, Region
 Products (Dim Table): Product ID, Name, Category
 Calendar (Dim Table): Date, Month, Year
Relationships:
 Sales[Customer ID] → Customers[Customer ID]
 Sales[Product ID] → Products[Product ID]
 Sales[Date] → Calendar[Date]
